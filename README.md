# My-Sudoku-Solver

An interpretable Sudoku solver that explains how it solves for each missing number. 
I implemented all the strategies that I had figured ou myself, but it does not include very advanced strategies 
and is thus not guaranteed to solve all difficult problems correctly. It should work fine for easy/medium problems.
